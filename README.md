# Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications

The **Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications** links humanitarian organizations and tech companies interested in uses of large language models for good. Members help one another scope projects, deploy models, troubleshoot code and carry out basic testing.

The partnership aims to help humanitarian actors overcome technical challenges associated with deploying sophisticated new generative AI models, speeding up applicational development through collaboration and resource sharing. Working through the partnership makes it easer for humanitarian actors to forge ties with generative AI players around humanitarian applications and around issues like trust and safety.

## Resources

The partnership provides members with direct channels to use to interface with one another and share resources, code, troubleshooting help and information on projects and technical needs.

The partnership primarily maintains a private **GitHub workspace** and Google Colab notebooks for member use.

## Members

Member | Partnership Intention
--- | ---
Humanitarian AI Meetup Groups | The Humanitarian AI meetup community links local groups in fifteen cities. Members discuss humanitarian applications of artificial intelligencre and work on volunteer projects. Through the partnershjip we hope to shorten the time it takes us to experiment with generative AI models. We're particular in helping fine-tune models and action transformers able to turn questions into database queries. We mainly bring to the table volunteers, expertise in IATI's open data sharing framework and a graph database storing an entire IATI corpos for member use.
Omdena | Omdena provides the global community of AI engineers with a platform to gather and collaboratively build solutions to real-world problems.

## Get Involved

The Partnership is semi-private and geared towards streamlining collaborative contact and resource sharing between members. Access to resources is open to members and to new member applicants. **Contact**: team (at) humanitarianai.org to learn more and to get involved.
