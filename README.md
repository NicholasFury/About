# Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications

The **Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications** links humanitarian organizations and tech companies interested in uses of large language models for good. Members help one another scope projects, deploy models, troubleshoot code and carry out basic testing.

The partnership aims to help humanitarian actors overcome technical challenges associated with deploying sophisticated new generative AI models, speeding up applicational development through collaboration and resource sharing. Working through the partnership makes it easer for humanitarian actors to forge ties with generative AI players around humanitarian applications and issues of trust and safety important to the humanitarian community.

## Resources

The partnership provides members with direct channels to use to interface with one another and share resources, code, troubleshooting help and information on projects and technical needs.

The partnership primarily maintains a private GitHub repository and Google Colab notebooks for member use.
